#
#  Before attempting to run this, you need to edit gen_input_file.c and set the location
#  of your reduced trees.  You should also put in any selection modifications.
#  You can use unskimmed, skimmed, or skimmed and slimmed reduced trees as input.
#
#  This assumes you are running tcsh for your shell and have the path to root set up already.
#  Source this file from the parent directory (hbb_stats).  That is, do this
#
#    source macros/all-in-one-tutorial
#
#  The first steps (gen_input_file, build_hbb_workspace, and fitqual_plots) should run in
#  one or two minutes.  The limit and significance toys will take around 10 minutes.
#
#  Sample output and log files can be found here, if you want to compare yours to mine.
